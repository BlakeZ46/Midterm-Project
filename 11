Model Fitting

log_top150$Language <- factor(log_top150$Language)
log_top150$Stream.time.minutes. <- log(log_top150$Stream.time.minutes. + 1)
log_top150$Peak.viewers  <- log(log_top150$Peak.viewers + 1)
log_top150$Average.viewers <- log(log_top150$Average.viewers + 1)
log_top150$Followers <- log(log_top150$Followers + 1)
